PHP Interview Test Part 1

- Works on a LAMP stack server with PHP version 7.1+
- Past experience was with Moodle Framework which is not universal and made no sense for this application as it is LMS based. I did not use any open source Frameworks as I believed it would have been more of a hinderous than helping me
- Guzzle was used to achieve asynchronous API calls
- PHPUnit was used for as the testing framework 
- .htaccess was used to handle in coming API calls (requires Apache to work.)
